# MBG Simple Wizard for WinForms

## Intro

The MBG Simple Wizard for WinForms is one of the first code libraries I ever published - back in 2010. It was hosted on CodePlex and since that has now been shut down, I have migrated the code here. Further details can be found on my CodeProject article here: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/120607/Simple-Wizard-for-WinForms
